## 3. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (L22210MH1995PLC084781)

Note: CSR expenditure may include global efforts, thus overstating the amount spent within India. One option for correcting this bias would be to calculate the proportion spent outside India in the first year of the CSR mandate and reduce the prior years by the same multiplier.

2007-08, 08-09 sustainability reports do not include CSR expenditure

Note: The report includes figures for both standalone and consolidated PAT but does not specify which figure the 1.70% spending amount is based on. The figures above are calculated on the standalone PAT of 1,701.12 crore rather than the consolidated figure of 1,802.68. This is because IDFC Ltd serves only the Indian market, while the broader IDFC group has operations overseas.
